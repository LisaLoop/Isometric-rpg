# Getting started

## Dependencies
- This project works with
- NPM version 6.13.4
- Node version 12.16.1
- TypeScript version greater than 4.1.5
- Ts-jest greater than 26.5.1

## NOTE
- every time you try to do anything you need to source the setup.sh file
`source setup.sh`

This will add the local .bin folder to the current path on the current terminal so we can run Webpack conveniently. 

To run webpack with live reload use the command
`webpack watch`
